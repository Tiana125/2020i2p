Let's imagine that we're setting up, say, a web site that allows you to search for properties that match a set of criteria and we've been asked to represent these properties as _objects_ so that someone searching for a specific type of property--or a property with a specific set of features--can find what they are looking for. We've been told that the listings can be found in an online file and are then asked to put together code to allow someone to look for properties in that file.[<sup>1</sup>](#fn1)"
