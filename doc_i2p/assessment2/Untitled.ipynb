    "\n",
    "Some justification methods of conducting an ethical data analysis are listed below:\n",
    "1. __Informed consent__:\n",
    "- Airbnb privacy policy informs users that information they share publicly on the platform ‘may be indexed through third-party search engines’ [3], which is applicable to web scrapes in this case. Therefore, the _data collection_ process is ethical. \n",
    "\n",
    "- However, it would be unethical to make user-specific data public _without consent_ to share from users themselves in advance. \n",

    "\n",
    "    Regarding identifying ‘professional’ hosts with many listings:  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The data analysis part is ethical because it is based only on public data, and the participants have been informed. However, it would be unethical to publish their names, associated listings, income, or any personal information, because this would violate their anonymity and confidentiality. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Although tenants that reside in regions that are flooded with short term lettings has indeed suffered from the unethical uses of Airbnb, this does not justify the action of exposing them to the public. Conducting ethical data analysis should always minimise the risk of harm to participants, regardless of what the data conveys. \n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of “__aggregation effect__” is to “generate intimate insights without the participants’ knowledge” by combining multiple data feeds [4]. Using this idea, one could integrate the first names and profile pictures of hosts to infer their races. This data could be associated with any _anonymous_ host-related analysis stated above ethically with caution. Nevertheless, making _assumptions_ of race specific _stereotypes_ would be unethical, e.g., different income levels, reviews scores of their listings between ethnic groups. With these assumptions in mind, one may _deliberately cherry-pick_ statistics that support their cause unintentionally, hence making this use of this data unethical. \n"
